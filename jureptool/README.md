# JuRepTool
## Detailed Job Report Generation Script

Jülich Reporting Tool: This program reads the data information generated by LLview and create PDF and HTML reports for running and recently-finished jobs. It uses Python's `multiprocessing` library to parallelize over the reports.

The configuration of the script and plots are given in 4 YAML files:
- `config.yml`: General configuration such as fontsize, page size, colors, etc.
- `system_info.yml`: Information on the system names, queues and sizes (cores, memory)
- `plots.yml`: Configuration of the sections and graphs to be plotted in each of them. Keywords from `system_info.yml` may be used in ylim.
- `logging.yml`: Logging information (filename, format, level)

Options that can be passed via SLURM `--comment` flag:
- `llview_plot_lines`: plot lines instead of colorplots (when `gpus=True` and `num_gps<=16`, or `gpus=False` and `num_gpus<=16`)

positional arguments:
  file                  File including list of running and recently-finished jobs or JSON file of a job

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --daemon              Run as a 'daemon', i.e., in an infinite loop
  --demo                Run in 'demo' mode (hide usernames, project id and job names)
  --nomove              Don't copy files to final location
  --nohtml              Deactivate generation of HTML
  --gzip                Compress HTML using gzip
  --plotlyjs PLOTLYJS   Location of the 'plotly.min.js' file (default: 'cdn')
  --maxjobs MAXJOBS     Maximum number of jobs to process (default: MAXJOBS=10000)
  --maxsec MAXSEC       Filter date range with maximum seconds range (default: no filter)
  --shutdown SHUTDOWN [SHUTDOWN ...]
                        File(s) that triggers the script to shutdown
  --nprocs NPROCS       Number of process to run in parallel (default: NPROCS=2)
  --loglevel LOGLEVEL   Select log level: 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR' (more to less verbose)
  --logprefix LOGPREFIX
                        Prefix for the daily log and errlog files
  --configfolder CONFIGFOLDER
                        Folder with YAML configuration files (default: src/../../configs/jureptool)
  --outfolder OUTFOLDER
                        Folder to store temporary and demo PDFs
  --semail SEMAIL       Sender email to use in case of errors (default: None)
  --remail REMAIL       Receiver email to use in case of errors (default: None)
```

In the current version, the pdfs are (temporarily) written to a local `./results` folder (it may be necessary to create it).

### Dependencies:

* matplotlib (>3.5.0)
* numpy
* pandas
* pyyaml
* plotly
* cmcrameri
* python compiled with gzip option (if compressed HTML are to be generated with option `--gzip`)

### After installation

* Install dependencies: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib plotly PyYAML cmcrameri`.
* Check `${LLVIEW_CONF}/jureptool` for prefix to be included in plotlists.dat items
* `mkdir ./results`
* Add required fonts (Liberation Sans or Arial, Liberation Mono or Courier New). Liberation fonts are free and can be downloaded from https://github.com/liberationfonts/liberation-fonts/releases.
Fonts can be installed with:
```
mkdir ~/.local/share/fonts/
cp <fonts_folder>/*.ttf ~/.local/share/fonts/
fc-cache -f
rm -fr ~/.cache/matplotlib
```
(on MacOs, matplotlib's cache folder is `~/.matplotlib`.)

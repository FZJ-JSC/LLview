# Server Folder Structure

The generated files are put into the folder defined in `$LLVIEW_DATA/$LLVIEW_SYSTEMNAME`.
The subfolders that used for the default steps are:

- `monitor`: Location of the log files for the main monitor script (that is run by the cronjob)
- `logs`: Location of the log files
    - `steps`: Folder storing temporary log files for each step of all actions that are created and overwritten during every cycle and also permanent error files that happen during the steps
- `perm`: Folder used by LLview to store files indicating a job is running, counters
    - `db`: Folder where SQLite databases are located
    - `keys`: Where SSH-keys for the [transferreports](server_install.md#transferreports) step are stored
    - `wservice`: Store the mapping of the Web Service accounts
- `tmp`: Location of the temporary LML files (e.g., the ones copied from `$LLVIEW_SHARED`)
    - `jobreport`: Files generated by the `jobreport` action
        - `data`: Folder that is copied to the Web Server
        - `tmp`: Contains the list of jobs JuRepTool needs to process and management files
- `arch`: Location of the archived files
    - `db`: csv files containing DB information
    - `LMLall`: Daily tarballs containing combined information of jobs
- `jureptool`: Folder used for temporary JuRepTool files and also location of default `shutdown` file (that stops only JuRepTool)
    - `results`: Where reports are first generated, and then moved to their final location (to avoid problems during copy to the Web Server)
